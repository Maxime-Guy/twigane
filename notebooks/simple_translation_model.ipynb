        "### How it works for long texts:\n",
        "1. **Automatic chunking**: Breaks long texts into sentences and groups them\n",
        "2. **Sentence-aware splitting**: Maintains meaning by respecting sentence boundaries  \n",
        "3. **Optimal chunk size**: Uses ~40 words per chunk for best translation quality\n",

        "### Recommendations:\n",
        "- **Best for**: Paragraphs and short essays (up to 500 words)\n",

        "- **Tip**: For very long documents, consider translating section by section\n",
